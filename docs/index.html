<h1>This is BatchOS</h1>

<p>BatchOS is an open source operating system that goes against the laws of computerpeople. It takes Batchfile and does something useful with it. For those of you who aren't scoffing, thanks. We appreciate it. The current release of DOSe is the buggiest OS ever next to Windows. There is (or are going to be) a text editor (oooooh), a user creation system (aaaaah), and there are five tiers of users. Guest, Under-Priviledged, User, Admin, and Root, each getting progressively more powerful. Enjoy!</p>
