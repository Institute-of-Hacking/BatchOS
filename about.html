<h1>Huh? What's this?</h1>
<p>BatchOS is a project dedicated to no specific purpose. It's just people who are bored that wanted to do something. Anyway, I wanted to make an OS that could be run on any windows system that supported Batchfile, which is a lot, so I made this, a text-based OS that isn't Unix based. I can't believe it either. I've only released a very buggy release, so I'd wait to download if I were you.</p>
