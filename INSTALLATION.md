# INSTALLATION

### Installation instructions for BatchOS

Unzip files from the cloned repo (recommended) or the .zip from the latest release (not recommended). 
If it is your first time running BatchOS, run usr-creation.bat and follow the instructions there. Once a user has been created, run DOSe4.0-beta and have some fun! The OS is meant to be fairly intuitive and does not have a 'walkthrough' of commands and features, rather an exploratory environment of which you should learn to navigate yourself.
