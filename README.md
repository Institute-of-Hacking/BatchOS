# DOSe

A note about the file DOSe4.0-beta.bat
This is the 4.0 beta of the **FILE**, not the operating system.
Other versions were either lost or too buggy to release. This is the best we can give you.

DOSe is a free, open source operating system (barely) that runs on anything that runs .bat files. On Windows, just run the file. 
For the Linux (aka the better operating system) users out there, get Wine at https://WineHQ.org
There is a good amount of documentation on that site and on other places on the internet.
OS/2 users (you naughty boy) have native Batchfile support. Really.
