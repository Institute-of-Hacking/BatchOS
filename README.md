# BatchOS

By 25zcj01 and NoIDont-zhara

BatchOS is a free, open source operating system (barely) that runs on anything that runs .bat files. On Windows, just run the file. 
For the Linux (aka the better operating system) users out there, get Wine at https://WineHQ.org
There is a good amount of documentation on that site and on other places on the internet.
